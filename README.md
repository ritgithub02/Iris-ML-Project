# Iris Data Classification

---

## Overview:

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for introductory tutorials and benchmarking algorithms.

## Dataset:

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal of this project is to build machine learning models that can accurately classify iris flowers into one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.

## Content:

- **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset to understand its structure, summary statistics, and any patterns or correlations present in the data.

- **Preprocessing:** Preprocess the data by handling missing values, scaling features if necessary, and encoding categorical variables.

- **Model Building:** Build several machine learning models using various algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes etc.

- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of each model using confusion matrix.


## Requirements:

- Python 3.11
- Required libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scipy

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
